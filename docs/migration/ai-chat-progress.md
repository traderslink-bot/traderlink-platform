# AI Companion Progress

## Status

Implementation is active. The parent plan is [TraderLink AI Companion Plan](ai-chat-plan.md).

## Accepted existing foundation

- AI Reviews has an approved weekly and calendar-month direction under
  [AI Reviews Plan](ai-weekly-review-plan.md).
- The replacement has owner-only provider/cost controls and immutable
  generation-cost tracking for review work.
- Current Focuses carry dated revisions for later review context.
- The complete language/query contract is finalized in the
  [AI Chatbot Complete Language Plan](traderslink_ai_chatbot_complete_language_plan.md).
- The category-by-category language delivery program is governed by the
  [AI Language Inventory Master](traderslink_ai_language_inventory_master.md)
  and its [required category template](category_completion_template_example.md).

## Planned work

- [x] Complete and link the AI Companion product plan and language/query plan.
- [x] Approve the complete integrated AI Companion direction for implementation.
- [x] Add the schema-only, account-scoped AI Chat foundation migration.
- [ ] Implement and verify the AI Reviews schedule/list/detail foundation.
- [x] Implement account-scoped Chat persistence, ordered-message history,
  immutable factual snapshots, and generation-receipt contracts over migration
  `0029`.
- [ ] Implement the separate Chat provider boundary and cost-control service.
- [ ] Complete the twenty-category language inventory program and review/lock
  its canonical vocabulary before generating runtime registries.
- [ ] Implement the private AI Chat experience and factual question families.
- [ ] Implement Daily Trade Tracker companion drafting/confirmation flow.
- [ ] Integrate conversational manual execution drafts with the canonical
  Journal preview and commit commands.
- [ ] Implement production entitlement, scheduled-delivery, operational, and
  privacy-deletion decisions at their separate launch boundaries.

## Completed: schema-only AI Chat foundation

- Migration `0029_coach_ai_chat_foundation` adds the seven planned private,
  account-scoped records for conversations, ordered messages, factual answer
  snapshots, generation receipts, manual-entry drafts, daily companion
  interactions and archive events.
- The schema retains private original user text separately from normalized and
  structured interpretation fields, bounds private text/JSON payload sizes,
  and keeps operational receipt rows free of conversation content.
- Assistant messages begin pending with one active generation per conversation.
  Completed answers require an immutable factual snapshot before their receipt;
  failed assistant attempts may retain an honest receipt when provider usage is
  available without inventing a snapshot, token count or cost.
- Manual-entry and daily companion records are drafts/proposals only. They can
  retain a later canonical Journal command/reference outcome, but have no
  execution or annotation write path. Confirmed manual rows freeze before the
  canonical save transition.
- Append-only triggers protect message/snapshot/receipt/archive history, and
  narrowly constrain conversation, assistant-generation, draft, daily-proposal
  and canonical-save state transitions. Conversation insertion requires an
  active workspace membership and matching Journal account workspace.

## Verification

- Focused one-worker migration tests passed: 13 tests across the `0029`
  migration, migration registry, and migration-file contract.
- Focused ESLint and `git diff --check` passed.
- The standalone migration-file verifier is deferred: its local Node process
  fails before file inspection with `uv_os_get_passwd` ENOMEM. No project
  configuration was changed to work around that local environment failure.

## Completed: private Chat persistence repository

- `CoachAiChatRepository` is server-only and verifies the current active user,
  workspace membership, and selected Journal account from the database for
  every operation. Conversation identifiers never bypass that scope.
- It creates, reads, renames, archives, and restores private conversations
  without deletion. Archive and restore append the immutable archive evidence.
- Conversation metadata and private message history are intentionally separate:
  message reads use a newest-page query with a default limit of 50, a maximum
  of 100, and a typed sequence cursor while returning each page in chronological
  order. This prevents an unbounded long-lived-history read.
- User-message append and pending-assistant reservation run in one immediate
  transaction. The repository preserves message sequence order and refuses a
  second pending assistant reservation for a conversation.
- Completed assistant messages are finalized in one transaction with a
  canonicalized immutable factual snapshot, SHA-256 digest, and generation
  receipt. Failed messages retain only a safe code and may record an honest
  usage receipt; neither path writes Journal facts, calls a provider, or creates
  a route/UI/manual-entry/daily-companion save path.
- Added focused one-worker repository tests covering cross-account denial, inactive
  membership, ordered reservations, duplicate-pending prevention, success and
  failure persistence, archive/restore, deterministic conversation and message
  pagination, and privacy-safe errors.

## Verification handoff

- Focused Vitest and ESLint for the repository slice are deliberately deferred
  to the coordinator's canonical checkout. This isolated worktree has no usable
  local `node_modules`; no dependency install, download, database migration, or
  configuration workaround was performed here.

## Explicit non-actions

- No Chat route, provider request, manual-execution write, daily-companion save,
  or AI change to Journal facts was made in the schema or persistence slices.
  The migration was verified only against disposable test databases; no real
  database was opened or changed.
- No V3 Coach runtime is a source for the new implementation.
